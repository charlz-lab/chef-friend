This is a Recipe app that I created out of convenience for people who cook. The app is built using React Native Elements and Expo. The features are displaying recent recipes, saved recipes, and allowing the user to create a grocery list. There are four react components, and three screens in total. 
For the grocery list component, I used a useState hook to change the state of the list when there is items inputted into the ListInput function. The RecipeBox component is used in both the Home component and the Recipes component. I used Stack Navigator to transition from the home page to the other two screens.
